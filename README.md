# Framework for Ham Radio

This repo contains an experimental framework for automating the workflow of an amateur radio operator (ham), which is currently in the early stages. The goal is to develop a disaggregated software stack that allows the end user to easily tailor the specific structure to a particular need by removing, modifying, or adding components.

You can read more about some of my thoughts [here](https://holdmybeer.io/2024/06/04/ham-stack-modernizing-the-wheel/), which may or may not be in sync with this repo. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
