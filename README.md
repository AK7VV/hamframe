# Framework for Ham Radio

This repo contains an experimental framework for automating the workflow of an amateur radio operator (ham), which is currently in the early stages. The goal is to develop a disaggregated software stack that allows the end user to easily tailor the specific structure to a particular need by removing, modifying, or adding components.

This is developed on multiple different \*NIX platforms.  If it doesn't work on whatever it is you're using, please open a github issue with details.  If you know how to fix it, please submit a PR. Thank you!
