This repo contains an experimental framework for automating the workflow of an amateur radio operator (ham). This work is currently in the early stages and probably not terribly useful as-is. The goal is to develop a disaggregated software stack that allows the end user to easily tailor the specific structure to a particular need by removing, modifying, or adding components.

This is developed on multiple different \*NIX platforms (most work is done on Debian related distros).  If it doesn't work on whatever it is you're using, please [open a github issue](https://github.com/ckuhtz/hamframe/issues) with details and maybe it will get fixed.  If you know how to fix it, please [submit a PR](https://github.com/ckuhtz/hamframe/pulls). Thank you!

You can read more about some of my thoughts [here](https://holdmybeer.io/2024/06/04/ham-stack-modernizing-the-wheel/), which may or may not be in sync with this repo. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ But they may explain some of the insanity behind this well-intentioned effort.

And it probably goes without saying.. feedback is very welcome.
